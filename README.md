## HackShopDC

Intended to be a regularly meetup for people to dive deep into a particular topic and set of open data to analyze, visualize and provide insight for addressing important issues.


## Vision Zero
HackShopDC kicks off it's first event - a mini hackathon on Vision Zero data! 

[Vision Zero](http://www.visionzeroinitiative.com/) is a national initiative to eliminate transit-related deaths and serious injuries. Each city determines its own target date to accomplish this goal.

[DC VisionZero](http://www.dcvisionzero.com/) goal is to accomplish this in the District by 2024. Vision Zero has a rich dataset of car, pedestrian and bike issues submitted by citizens. We will be joined by DDOT who will introduce and explain the data. 

Jonathon Rogers from DDOT will be our government expert providing background and guidance.

Let's work together to analyze and visualize transit issues in the District!
