This bicycle count data is provided by DDOTâ€™s Bicycle Program Specialist and is in the public domain.

The two CSV files cover general bike counts, including road information, sidewalk cycling, helmet status, gender, number of CaBi bikes, and more. DC has published a [corresponding spatial dataset of the count locations](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/13ced1ecaa9c4354bf774e27fe3c00ab_66).

The GeneralCountStats xls file has worksheets for every year of bike counts as well as other breakdowns across all years (like gender, CaBi bikes, etc).

The three detailcounts xls files give detailed information in fifteen-minute intervals for three data collection locations on one day in July, 2015.
